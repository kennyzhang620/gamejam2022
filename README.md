## Game Description

In Voyager, you find yourself on a dark ship, with blaring alarms, and an AI assistant telling you to turn the ship emergency power on. You must then manager the ship's different system and prevent a chain reaction of catastrophic events from occuring. This includes nuclear reactor meltdowns, ateroid collisions and computer overloads. 

This game is 3D with first person POV. You can also fly the ship through an asteroid field while trying to avoid collisions (in 3D too).
